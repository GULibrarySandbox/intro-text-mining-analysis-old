# Why use digital methods with text? 

-----

### Text is everywhere

Text is the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator.

The Prosecution Project is a collaborative research project on the history of the criminal trial in Australia from 1788 to 1960. Sources of text data included Supreme Court crimial trial registers, Police Gazettes nontices, Prison and Convict Registers, along with press releases and other newspaper articles  [https://prosecutionproject.griffith.edu.au/](https://prosecutionproject.griffith.edu.au/).

### Text is data, big or small

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse [news texts](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/17524032.2015.1056542) and [social media feeds](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/13669877.2019.1673798)
- qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of [interview transcripts](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/386927) 
- political scientists analyse [collections of speeches](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/401011) and [parliamentary transcripts](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248016000304)
- engineering researchers examine [accident reports](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/document/7277059)
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and [new research](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/380293)
- literary scholars work with digitized [single texts](https://academic-oup-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/dsh/article/32/suppl_1/i17/2755123), [multiple versions](http://librarycatalogue.griffith.edu.au/record=b2773844) of text, [whole corpus or person-of-interest collections](https://publications.hse.ru/en/chapters/158772968)
- environmental scientists undertake [network analysis of research literature](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/403109)
- medical researchers analyse electronic [patient records](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5)
- legal scholars examine [case law and legislation](https://www-annualreviews-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843#_i9)

### Digital collections enable us to build a corpus or dataset of text

The digitisation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing, indexing, encoding, and online hosting of primary source materials by archives, libraries, museums and galleries has enabled greater access, and new ways to find, explore, process and analyse text. 

{% capture text %}
Prosecution Project researchers worked with a team of eResearch specialists and database and web designers to develop a structured database managed through a secure web portal. With the support of volunteers, they undertook massive digitisation, transcription and indexing work resulting in a longitudinal database of criminal prosecutions never before available in Australia. They also recognized the potential of enriching the data via links to the sources used such as newspaper articles in National Library of Australia TROVE database.

### Computational methods 

Automating repetative tasks, working with numbers and big data, are all things computers are good at, but what about text?  You can use computational methods with text to:
- increase [validity](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1177%2F1466138117725340)
- [repeat processes and analysis](https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/) on other other text or corpus
- enable broader questions of [larger corpora](https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html)
- help understand texts and [underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=5772971)
- expand textual studies with [temporal or geographical context](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#exploring-change-over-time)
- create [visual exploration](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) of text
- use [statistical analysis methods](https://journals-sagepub-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X02030002003)


Now that you have explored some of the reasons researchers use text mining and analytics, let's investigate some methods and workflows, starting with where to find and how to build a text collection or corpus.
