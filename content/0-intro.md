# Text mining and analysis 

-----

## Text is everywhere

As stated by Sinclair and Rockwell (2016), text is at present and in recorded history the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information". Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator. 

## Digital collections

The digitisation, OCR processing, indexing, linking and hosting of primary source materials by archives, libraries, museums and galleries has 
enabled greater access, and new ways to find, explore, process and analyse text. 

## Text as data, big and small

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse streams of news texts and social media feeds
- qualitative sociologists process hundreds of hours of interview transcripts 
- political scientists analyse collections of speeches and parliamentary transcripts
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and new research
- literary scholars work digitally with single texts, multiple versions of text, whole corpus or person-of-interest collections
- scientists analyse research literature and communication
- medical and engineering researchers undertake systematic quantitative literature reviews

## Computational methods

- can increase validity or reduce human bias
- are repeatable across other data
- enable broader questions of larger corpora
- help understand texts and underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale
- expand textual studies with temporal or geographical context 
- allow visual exploration of text
- use statistical analysis methods
