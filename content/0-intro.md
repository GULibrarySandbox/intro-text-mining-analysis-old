# Text mining and analysis 

-----

### Text is everywhere

Text is at present and in recorded history the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator. 

Case study: The Prosecution Project is a collaborative research project on the history of the criminal trial in Australia from 1788 to 1960. Sources of text data included Supreme Court crimial trial registers, Police Gazettes nontices, Prison and Convict Registers which are commonly located in the country's State Archives (also known as Public Record Offices in some states and territories), along with press releases and other newspaper articles  https://prosecutionproject.griffith.edu.au/

### Digital collections

The digitisation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing, indexing, linking and online hosting of primary source materials by archives, libraries, museums and galleries has enabled greater access, and new ways to find, explore, process and analyse text. 

Case study: It was a massive digitisation, transcription and indexing project 

### Text as data, big and small

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse streams of news texts and social media feeds
- qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of interview transcripts 
- political scientists analyse collections of speeches and parliamentary transcripts
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and new research
- literary scholars work digitally with single texts, multiple versions of text, whole corpus or person-of-interest collections
- scientists undertake network analysis research literature
- medical researchers analyse electronic patient records
- engineers can explore trends and patterns via text in quality documentation

### Computational methods

Automating repetative tasks, working with numbers and big data, are all things computers are good at, but what about text?  You can use computational methods with text to:
- increase validity or reduce human bias
- repeat across other text or collections
- enable broader questions of larger corpora
- help understand texts and underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale
- expand textual studies with temporal or geographical context 
- allow visual exploration of text
- use statistical analysis methods
