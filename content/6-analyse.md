# Analysis methods and tools

-----

## Plug and Play analysis tools

Plug and play tools are interfaces where you can easily add data and analysis is done for you. The tools run on your web browser and are also know as Graphic user interface or GUI tools. The majority of these tools will be based up python or R analysis codes. We can use these tools for simple data analysis and visulations, they are really useful in getting started with analysis and getting an idea of what your data holds. 

- Pro's - easy to use, high level analysis, 
- Cons - often inflexible, not good for deeper analysis

#### These tools generally visualise datasets
- Voyant
- Raw graphs

## code

The use of computational analysis techniques in humanities reserach is the start point of Digital humanities reserach. 
Using code for analysis can show us paterns and connections not seen through close reading alone. The use of code in analysis can help us find greater meaning in the data.
In digital humanites we generally use R and Python for analysis of cour corpus.

#### common types of analysis
- sentiment analysis
- text mining
- mapping
- plotting data 

These analysis types can tell us if a text is positive or negative, the occurance of key themes within a text, maps show not only locations but movements of people, the growth of cities and how we have changed the landscape.

sentiment analysis - "Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral."( 2021 Top 5 Unknown Sentiment Analysis Projects On Github To Help You Through Your NLP Projects, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/top-5-unknown-sentiment-analysis-projects-on-github-to-help-you-through-your-nlp-projects-8d8f195e80fc)

For this activity take a look at the example DH project,  think about the process taken to get from the original resources to the final analyzed product.
If possible, see if you can identify the tools and coding packages used to undertake the project.{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity " text=text %}

### Pathways to analysis

no matter what data you are starting with, it is important that you have an idea of what you hope your analysis will tell you.

clean data - transcibe, annotated
