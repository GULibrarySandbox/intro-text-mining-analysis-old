## Research data ethics

{% capture text %}
When working with data that includes information about people it is vitally important that you have ethical clearance â€” even when working with publicly available datasets.
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

Note that if you plan on obtaining your data by scraping webpages you may be inadvertently gathering personal information.

Here we will add a reference to the National Statement on the [Ethical Conduct in Human Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018). The Griffith policy just points to this one anyway. 

Before undertaking reserach on exisitng datasets, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the use of the data, contact [Griffith research ethics](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/research-ethics-integrity).

### Gaining access and permission

The level of permission you need to use and reuse research data depends on several variables, who owns the data, how you got the data and what you intend to use the data for.

When using data from a repository - data permissions

when scraping for, or creating original data
 
  
When publishing the data - sensitive data,  de- identified data
