## Research data ethics

{% capture text %}
When working with data that includes information about people it is vitally important that you have ethical clearance — even when working with publicly available datasets.
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

> Note that if you plan on obtaining your data by scraping webpages you may be inadvertently gathering personal information.

Here we will add a reference to the National Statement on the [Ethical Conduct in Human Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018). The Griffith policy just points to this one anyway. 

Before undertaking research on existing datasets, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the use of the data, contact [Griffith research ethics](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/research-ethics-integrity).

## Gaining access and permission

When you are working with data you have generated yourself, or with text that is out of copyright and in the public domain (see below), then there will be no conditions attached to your use of the data.

{% capture text %}
This does not mean there are no ethical considerations!
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

However, if you are using a dataset built, created or maintained by someone else, you will always be accessing it under the terms of some license or other. It might be an open license such as Creative Commons or the Unlicense

The level of permission you need to use and reuse research data depends on several variables, who owns the data, how you got the data and what you intend to use the data for.

When using data from a repository - data permissions

when scraping for, or creating original data

When publishing the data - sensitive data,  de- identified data

## Data copyright

> Accessing and downloading data is one thing — publishing it is another. Obtaining permission to do one does not mean you have permission to do the other.


If you have created the textual data yourself (e.g. by conducting interviews or surveys), then you own the copyright and you do not need to seek copyright clearance, provided you do not substantially reproduce your subjects' exact words (note that the ethical considerations listed above still apply). The same applies for material that is out of copyright or is in the public domain. 

Specific sites have specific terms explaining how researchers may access their data and what they are permitted to do with it. Some are very generous with their access provisions, while some do not allow re-use at all. Many sites allow their data to be used for research but prohibit commercial re-use.


A quick checklist might be: 

How will the data be downloaded? Directly from the web, or via an API?
To what degree is the data set in the public domain? Who is it owned by, if not?
Is there an agreement or terms of use that you agreed to? What does it say about allowed or excluded uses?
Do you have any plans to commercialise your research? Is that allowed by your access agreement?
Will your published data be 'substantially similar' to the mined dataset?
Will you be mixing different data sources? You might need to comply with both sets of terms, if they exist.
