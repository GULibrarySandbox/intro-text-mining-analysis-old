When working with data it is vitally important that you have the right ethical permissions and clearances, this is true even when working with publically available datasets. This is particularly important if you plan on webscraping pages for data. Before undertaking reserach on exisitng datasets, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the use of the data, contact Griffith research ethics <a href='https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/research-ethics-integrity' target="_blank"> here <a/>  

Reserach data permissions 

The level of permission you need to use and reuse research data depends on several variables, who owns the data, how you got the data and what you intend to use the data for. 
When using a repository - data permissions

scraping for data, creating original data
  
publishing the data - sensitive data,  de- identified data
