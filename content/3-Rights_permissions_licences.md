When working with data it is vitally important that you have the right ethical permissions and clearances, this is true even when working with publically available datasets. This is particularly important if you plan on webscraping pages for data. Before undertaking reserach on exisitng datasets, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the use of the data, contact Griffith research ethics <href='https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/research-ethics-integrity' target="_blank"<here<a/>
