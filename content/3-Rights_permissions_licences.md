When working with data it is vitally important that you have the right ethical permissions and clearances even when working with publicly available datasets.

{% include alert.html text=text color="warning" %}

This is particularly important if you plan on webscraping pages for data. Before undertaking reserach on exisitng datasets, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the use of the data, contact Griffith research ethics <a href='https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/research-ethics-integrity' target="_blank"> here </a>

### Research data permissions

When using data from a repository - data permissions

when scraping for, or creating original data
 
  
When publishing the data - sensitive data,  de- identified data
