# Why use digital methods with text? 

-----

### Text is everywhere

Text is the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator. 


### Text is data, big or small

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse [news texts](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/17524032.2015.1056542) and [social media feeds](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/13669877.2019.1673798)
- qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of [interview transcripts](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/386927) 
- political scientists analyse [collections of speeches](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/401011) and [parliamentary transcripts](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248016000304)
- engineering researchers examine [accident reports](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/document/7277059)
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and [new research](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/380293)
- literary scholars work with digitized [single texts](https://academic-oup-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/dsh/article/32/suppl_1/i17/2755123), [multiple versions](http://librarycatalogue.griffith.edu.au/record=b2773844) of text, [whole corpus or person-of-interest collections](https://publications.hse.ru/en/chapters/158772968)
- environmental scientists undertake [network analysis of research literature](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/403109)
- medical researchers analyse electronic [patient records](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5)
- legal scholars examine [case law and legislation](https://www-annualreviews-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843#_i9)


Now that you have explored some of the reasons researchers use text mining and analytics, let's investigate some methods and workflows, starting with where to find and how to build a text collection or corpus.
