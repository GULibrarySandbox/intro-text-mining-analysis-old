# What is text mining and analysis?

### Building a corpus or text-based dataset

### Applying computational methods to explore and analyse text

Automating repetative tasks, working with numbers and big data, are all things computers are good at, but what about text?  

You can use computational methods with text to:
- increase [validity](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1177%2F1466138117725340)
- [repeat processes and analysis](https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/) on other other text or corpus
- enable broader questions of [larger corpora](https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html)
- help understand texts and [underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=5772971)
- expand textual studies with [temporal or geographical context](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#exploring-change-over-time)
- create [visual exploration](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) of text
- use [statistical analysis methods](https://journals-sagepub-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X02030002003)

It runs inside your Web browser, but no internet connection is needed to use it, unless you want to bring in Web-based data for cleaning. Once web-based data has been read into OpenRefine, no further internet connection is needed.


{% capture text %}
- Identify where data is missing
- Fix inconsistencies such as date formats, name case format and order
- Find and correct errors inlcuding misspellings, typos, whitespace
- Find and remove duplicate observations
- Identify and fix illegal values (data that does not fall within the accepted range for the variable)
- Map the meaning of the dataset to its structure, see ['Tidy data'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Clean & standardise data" text=text %}
