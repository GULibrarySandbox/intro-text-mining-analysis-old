# Introduction to the analysis of digital texts and tools

This page is about using computational methods to analyse text based data sets.  This is a growing and fluid space with new tools and resources constantly being developed for use. 
the content on these pages will help you create and build computataionally analysable data sets,  introduce computational methods for analysis for both plug and play tools and through code. 

Digital humanities is a fluid growing area or research, how we define Digital humanities changes as new ideas are introduced 
<a href ='https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/' target=_"blank">check here for todays defintion <a/>

We analyse text based resources to find new meanings, to show connections and add value to our research.

### Insights from text 

Text is considered even in the 21st century, the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator.  

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse [news texts](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/17524032.2015.1056542) and [social media feeds](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/13669877.2019.1673798)
- qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of [interview transcripts](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/386927) 
- political scientists analyse [collections of speeches](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/401011) and [parliamentary transcripts](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248016000304)
- engineering researchers examine [accident reports](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/document/7277059)
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and [new research](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/380293)
- literary scholars work with digitized [single texts](https://academic-oup-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/dsh/article/32/suppl_1/i17/2755123), [multiple versions](http://librarycatalogue.griffith.edu.au/record=b2773844) of text, [whole corpus or person-of-interest collections](https://publications.hse.ru/en/chapters/158772968)
- environmental scientists undertake [network analysis of research literature](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/403109)
- medical researchers analyse electronic [patient records](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5)
- legal scholars examine [case law and legislation](https://www-annualreviews-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843#_i9)

### Computational methods

Text mining is the use of computational methods to extract data from collections of unstructured or semi-structured text. In the humanities this is often described as distant reading of a corpus (text collection).  The goal of text mining is to discover & extract information or patterns hidden in text.  

There is a long research tradition in text analysis in the humanities and with the explosion in digital text, computational analysis methods have developed in fields including statistics, computer science, (computational) linguistics, and library science.

Explore one of the reasons why computational methods are used in text research below:
- increase [validity](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1177%2F1466138117725340)
- [repeat processes and analysis](https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/) on other other text or corpus
- enable broader questions of [larger corpora](https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html)
- help understand texts and [underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=5772971)
- expand textual studies with [temporal or geographical context](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#exploring-change-over-time)
- create [visual exploration](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) of text, see also image below
- to undertake [statistical analysis](https://journals-sagepub-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X02030002003)of text{% endcapture %} {% include card.md header="Activity: explore text research using computational methods" text=text %}

Below is an example of an interactive visual exploration of Francis Bacon's network of associations, created by a group of researchers using computational methods with text.  It is interactive and can be explored at [http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/).
