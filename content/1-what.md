# What is text mining and analysis?

-----

Text mining is the science of data mining collections of unstructured or semi-structured text(described in some disciplines as corpus). The goal of the process is to discover & extract knowledge, information or patterns, hidden in text (Hearst, 1999).  

Text is pre-processed using methods below to enable computational analysis:




Text analysis and computational methods are applied to the text collections including:
- thematic analysis
- sentiment analysis
- term frequency
- content analysis

### Text is everywhere

Text is the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator. 

### Computational methods to explore and analyse text

Automating repetative tasks, working with numbers and big data, are all things computers are good at, but what about text?  

You can use computational methods with text to:
- increase [validity](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1177%2F1466138117725340)
- [repeat processes and analysis](https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/) on other other text or corpus
- enable broader questions of [larger corpora](https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html)
- help understand texts and [underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=5772971)
- expand textual studies with [temporal or geographical context](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#exploring-change-over-time)
- create [visual exploration](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) of text
- use [statistical analysis methods](https://journals-sagepub-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X02030002003)

### Insights from text

We are all, regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, trying to gain insights from text.

- communication scholars analyse [news texts](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/17524032.2015.1056542) and [social media feeds](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/13669877.2019.1673798)
- qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of [interview transcripts](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/386927) 
- political scientists analyse [collections of speeches](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/401011) and [parliamentary transcripts](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248016000304)
- engineering researchers examine [accident reports](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/document/7277059)
- historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and [new research](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/380293)
- literary scholars work with digitized [single texts](https://academic-oup-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/dsh/article/32/suppl_1/i17/2755123), [multiple versions](http://librarycatalogue.griffith.edu.au/record=b2773844) of text, [whole corpus or person-of-interest collections](https://publications.hse.ru/en/chapters/158772968)
- environmental scientists undertake [network analysis of research literature](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/403109)
- medical researchers analyse electronic [patient records](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5)
- legal scholars examine [case law and legislation](https://www-annualreviews-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843#_i9)
