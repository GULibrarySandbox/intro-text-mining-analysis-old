# What is text mining and analysis

Text mining is the use of computational methods to extract data from collections of unstructured or semi-structured text. The goal of text mining is to discover & extract information or patterns hidden in text, often across large collections of text.  

There is a long research tradition in text analysis in the humanities and with the explosion in digital text, computational analysis methods have developed in fields including statistics, computer science, (computational) linguistics and library science.  [Distant reading](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/pmla/article/race-and-distant-reading/6646170D88722BB195E40D4352BCDA1A) (quantitative analysis) of a digitised text or corpus (text collection) is a well known humanities analysis method. 

All researchers regardless of discipline, methodology, or objective, can gain insights from text.
- Communication scholars analyse [news texts](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/17524032.2015.1056542) and [social media feeds](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1080/13669877.2019.1673798)
- Qualitative sociologists process and analyse hundreds of hours of [interview transcripts](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/386927) 
- Political scientists analyse [collections of speeches](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/401011) and [parliamentary transcripts](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0738248016000304)
- Engineering researchers examine [accident reports](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/document/7277059)
- Historians access primary source materials from remote repositories enabling broader perspectives and [new research](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/380293)
- Literary scholars work with digitized [single texts](https://academic-oup-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/dsh/article/32/suppl_1/i17/2755123), [multiple versions](http://librarycatalogue.griffith.edu.au/record=b2773844) of text, [whole corpus or person-of-interest collections](https://publications.hse.ru/en/chapters/158772968)
- Environmental scientists undertake [network analysis of research literature](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/403109)
- Medical researchers analyse electronic [patient records](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5)
- Legal scholars examine [case law and legislation](https://www-annualreviews-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-052720-121843#_i9)

# Why use computational methods

Text is considered even in the 21st century, the main form for "communicating, discovering and processing information" [(Sinclair and Rockwell, 2016)](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=4093339).  Even popular non written forms of communication such as streamed videos are largely inaccessible without text-based searches of metadata such as title, description or creator, or from text within transcripts.  

{% capture text %}
Explore some of the reasons researchers use computational methods to analysis text:
- increase [validity](https://doi-org.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/10.1177%2F1466138117725340)
- [repeat processes and analysis](https://glam-workbench.net/hansard/) on other other text or corpus
- enable broader questions of [larger corpora](https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html)
- help understand texts and [underlying social and cultural phenomena at scale](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/lib/griffith/detail.action?docID=5772971)
- expand textual studies with [temporal or geographical context](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#exploring-change-over-time)
- create [visual exploration](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/) of text, see also image below
- to undertake [statistical analysis](https://journals-sagepub-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X02030002003) of text
