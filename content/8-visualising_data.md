### Visualisation methods and tools

Visualising data can help us understand complex information quickly. Transforming data into a visual format can:

- reveal patterns and relationships
- identify trends
- communicate insights with impact

The content on this page has been adapted from our self paced training resource available <a href='https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/data-vis-basics/' target='_blank'> here </a>


## Requirements
before you start you will need to know the image quality requirements of visulations. we cover this in detail in the linked workshop. 

### Choose the right visualisation type for your data 

Explore From [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) interactive help to find the most appropriate graph for your data.

Then check out the images below to identify which tool can create the chart type you need.

The Data to Viz team also provide a collection of really useful tips and caveats for using charts [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html).

## Types of visualistaions

The type of visualisations you can create are somewhat governed by the types of data you are working with. 

With structured data or tabular sets we can generate visualisations using tools such as; 
- excel spread sheets, 
- RawGraphs
- computational code. 

With unstrucutred data, generally prose, articles, diary entries and alike, <a href='https://voyant-tools.org/' target='_blank'>Voyant tools</a> will generate easy to use visualisations. For more complex analysis and visualisation we can use Python code.

For mapping data we can use tools such as <a href='https://aurin.org.au/' target='_blank'>AURIN </a>, and even google earth. For Aurin you will need structured datasets with coordinates.
