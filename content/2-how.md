### Activities and workflows


A text mining and analysis workflow is a messy, iterative and complex process. Itâ€™s often like the diagram below. "Depending on the project, a researcher may repeat certain steps in small cycles, or return to previous steps, or do some exploratory steps to determine next steps." (Green, et al. 2018)

### Text as data considerations

Consider the questions below when embarking on a text mining project.

- Do you already have a dataset, corpus or text source? GLAM catalogues, subscription databases, websites, social media are all great sources [here, link to new libguide]
- Is the text you want to use already digitised? Handwriting, OCR recognition or even Speech to Text services might be needed, and lot of cleaning after
- Are there copyright or licencing concerns? Some collections, particularly before a certain date provide licences for use such as [TROVE](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) from The National Library of Australia, or you can request permission from copyright owners for subscription databases via the [Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/contact). Griffith's [Information Policy Officer](https://www.griffith.edu.au/copyright-matters/research-staff) can provide advice on specific use cases.
- How much technical experience do you need? Some tools and methods are plug and play, which we will explore and others require coding. [eResearch Services](https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services) run regular coding workshops and provide great support via Hacky Hour.
- Do you have funding?  Sometimes you need to pay for access to OCR text from vendor sources.


### Prepare text for processing


### Computationally process text to extract data

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques

-	Sentence splitting
-	Tokenization
-	Part-of-speech tagging
-	Shallow parsing
-	Named entity recognition
-	Syntactic parsing
-	(Semantic Role Labeling)?? source: Dr. Yoshimasa Tsuruoka's tutorial at the National Centre for Text Mining here: http://www.nactem.ac.uk/teaching/ 

Machine learning 

The processes then enable tasks such as:

- "find and compare the number of instances of particular terms over time in a defined corpus"
- "finding the relative frequency of the words in a text and then visualising these in a way that makes the different frequencies apparent, for example, by size and position in word clouds"
- topic modeling - "identify groups of terms that tend to be representative of a given topic" Toon, E., Timmermann, C., & Worboys, M. (2016). Text-mining and the history of medicine: Big data, big questions? Medical History, 60(2), 294-296. https://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2016.18 
- named entity recognition 


### Analyse
Computational text analysis methods include:
- thematic analysis
- sentiment analysis
- content analysis
- network analysis 
- .....

### Visualise
