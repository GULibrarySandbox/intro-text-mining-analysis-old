# How - the steps in text mining and analysis

-----

### Activities and workflows


A text mining and analysis workflow is a messy, iterative and complex process. Itâ€™s often like the diagram below. "Depending on the project, a researcher may repeat certain steps in small cycles, or return to previous steps, or do some exploratory steps to determine next steps." (Green, et al. 2018)

### Considerations

Consider the questions below when embarking on a text mining and analysis project.

**Do you have a dataset, corpus or text source?**
- GLAM catalogues, subscription databases, websites and social media are good sources if you aren't collecting your own text data from interviews or surveys. Find sources via the [Texting mining guide](https://libraryguides.griffith.edu.au/text-mining).

**Is the text you want to use already digitised?**
- If the text is in the form of a modern PDF it should not need any further amendments. Handwritten texts will require OCR recognition tools or manual transcription.  With older PDFs you will need to transcribe or convert the materials to a machine readible format. 

**What are the copyright or licencing requirements?**
- Some collections, particularly before a certain date provide licences for use such as [TROVE](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) from The National Library of Australia, or
- You can request permission from copyright owners for subscription databases via the [Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/contact). 
- Griffith's [Information Policy Officer](https://www.griffith.edu.au/copyright-matters/research-staff) can provide advice on specific use cases.

**How much technical experience do you need?**
- Some tools and methods are plug and play, which we will explore and others require coding. 
- [eResearch Services](https://www.griffith.edu.au/eresearch-services) run regular coding workshops and provide great support via Hacky Hour.

**Do you have funding?**
- Sometimes you need to pay for access to OCR text from vendor sources or text and audio transcription services.

### Text mining and analysis workflow steps

The most common steps in the workflow include: 
- Finding and building the dataset 
- Preparing text, audio or video for processing
- Computationally processing text to extract data
- Analysing text using computational methods
- Visualising text using computational methods

Before exploring each of these activities, let's identify your ehtical obligations in the next lesson.
