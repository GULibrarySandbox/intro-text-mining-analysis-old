# Introduction to Data Wrangling with OpenRefine
Self-paced [online workshop](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/intro-data-wrangle/) developed by [Griffith University Library](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library).

OpenRefine is an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. OpenRefine is particularly powerful when working with large datasets.

Learn basic data cleaning techniques in this self-paced online workshop such as:

- exploring tabular data through facets and filters
- implementing ‘tidy data’ principles
- cleaning, organising and preparing data for analysis
- extracting and using a script to automate wrangling on similar data
    
Download the software and dataset, do activities and watch videos to guide you through the lessons. Give yourself around 2 1/2 hours to complete the workshop.
